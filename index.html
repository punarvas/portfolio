    <p>Hello, my name is Akash Mahajan and I am pursuing MS in Artificial Intelligence from University of Michigan
        Dearborn.
        I completed my bachelors from Rajarambapu Institute of Technology in Information Technology. Before joining
        University of
        Michigan, I worked as a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Management Calcutta for 9 months.
    </p>

    <p>I worked on using machine learning for predicting leaf diseases on ridge gourd plant and forecasting the air
        quality index PM2.5
        in several indian cities. My inspiration is driven by my dream to benefit my native place with affordable smart
        solutions based on AI.</p>
